# Wonderer-s_scripts

### [Description]

The bash scripts I use for my servers for updating and setting up applications.
Currently there are only two scripts for Ubuntu and I plan to add scripts for photon OS and other applications. 

### [Support]

You can use this however you like; you can fork it and even request pull requests.

### [Warnings]

Forge is not java backwards compatible, so forge versions running java 8 will not run java 11 or 17 up.
If you don't want all the programs to default to java 8 when you install and manually set it up. try instead to specify the java 8 directory instead of setting java 8 as the primary version.
